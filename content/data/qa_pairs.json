      "question": "What is DSPy?",
      "context": "DSPy is a framework for building and optimizing language model applications. It treats LLMs as programmable components that can be composed together, with automatic optimization capabilities.",
      "answer": "A framework for composing and optimizing language model applications"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How does optimization work in DSPy?",
      "context": "DSPy optimization takes training data and a metric to systematically improve your program. Different optimizers like BootstrapFewShot and MIPRO can generate better prompts and demonstrations automatically.",
      "answer": "By automatically generating better prompts and examples using training data and metrics"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What are signatures in DSPy?",
      "context": "Signatures define the input/output contract of a task. They can be specified as strings like 'question -> answer' or as Python classes with type hints and descriptions.",
      "answer": "Specifications that define what inputs and outputs a task requires"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the difference between Predict and ChainOfThought?",
      "context": "Predict is a basic module that directly produces outputs from inputs. ChainOfThought extends this by asking the model to show its reasoning steps, typically improving accuracy on complex tasks.",
      "answer": "ChainOfThought includes reasoning steps, while Predict produces outputs directly"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "How can I compose multiple modules together?",
      "context": "You can create a custom Module subclass with multiple predictor attributes and use them in the forward() method. Pass outputs from one module as inputs to the next to build pipelines.",
      "answer": "By creating a custom Module class and chaining outputs through forward()"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is RAG?",
      "context": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines document retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and includes them in the prompt to improve answer quality.",
      "answer": "A technique combining retrieval of relevant documents with text generation"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "How do I evaluate my DSPy program?",
      "context": "Use dspy.evaluate.Evaluate with your program, a test dataset, and a metric function that returns True/False. The evaluator will run your program on the test set and report the metric score.",
      "answer": "Using dspy.evaluate.Evaluate with a metric function on your test set"
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What optimizers are available?",
      "context": "DSPy provides several optimizers: BootstrapFewShot for automatic example selection, MIPRO for joint instruction and demonstration optimization, KNNFewShot for similarity-based selection, and fine-tuning for small LM adaptation.",
      "answer": "BootstrapFewShot, MIPRO, KNNFewShot, and fine-tuning"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Can I use DSPy with open-source models?",
      "context": "Yes, DSPy supports various LM backends including OpenAI, Anthropic, local models via Ollama, and other providers. You configure the LM using dspy.configure().",
      "answer": "Yes, through various providers including local models via Ollama"
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is a Signature in DSPy?",
      "context": "A Signature defines the I/O contract of a task. It specifies what inputs are needed and what outputs should be produced, with optional descriptions for each field.",
      "answer": "An I/O contract specification for a DSPy task"
    }
