    "# Chain of Thought Module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Previous Section**: [The Predict Module](./02-predict-module.md) - Understanding of basic modules\n",
    "- **Chapter 2**: Signatures - Familiarity with signature design\n",
    "- **Required Knowledge**: Concept of step-by-step reasoning\n",
    "- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate\n",
    "- **Estimated Reading Time**: 40 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will:\n",
    "- Master the `dspy.ChainOfThought` module for complex reasoning tasks\n",
    "- Understand how to elicit step-by-step thinking from language models\n",
    "- Learn to structure reasoning chains for different types of problems\n",
    "- Discover techniques to improve reasoning quality and reliability\n",
    "- Know when Chain of Thought outperforms simple prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Chain of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages language models to \"think step by step\" before providing a final answer. This approach significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Chain of Thought Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without CoT:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: If a rope is 10 meters long and we cut it into 4 equal pieces, then cut each piece in half, how many pieces do we have?\n",
    "Answer: 4  (Wrong - jumps to conclusion)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With CoT:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: If a rope is 10 meters long and we cut it into 4 equal pieces, then cut each piece in half, how many pieces do we have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "1. Start with 1 rope\n",
    "2. Cut into 4 equal pieces → now we have 4 pieces\n",
    "3. Cut each of the 4 pieces in half → each piece becomes 2 pieces\n",
    "4. Total pieces = 4 pieces × 2 = 8 pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 8  (Correct - shows reasoning)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
