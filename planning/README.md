# Planning Documents (Archive)

These documents contain planning notes and reviews that should eventually 
be migrated to GitHub Issues and Projects for better tracking.

## Files in this directory:
- `uiux.md` - UI/UX design notes
- `update_plan.md` - Repository refactoring plan

## Recommendation
For future planning work, consider using GitHub Issues and Projects instead 
of markdown files to enable better collaboration, tracking, and visibility.
