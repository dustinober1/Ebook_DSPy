# Chapter 5: Optimizers & Compilation

## Overview

Welcome to Chapter 5 where we explore one of DSPy's most powerful features: automatic optimization and compilation. While earlier chapters taught you how to build DSPy programs manually, this chapter shows you how DSPy can automatically optimize your programs for better performance.

### What You'll Learn

- **Compilation Concept**: Understanding what compilation means in DSPy
- **BootstrapFewShot**: Automatic few-shot example generation
- **MIPRO**: Multi-step instruction and demonstration optimization
- **KNNFewShot**: Similarity-based example selection
- **Fine-tuning**: Optimizing small language models
- **Choosing Optimizers**: Decision guide for different scenarios

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Understand the compilation process in DSPy
2. Use different optimizers to improve program performance
3. Select the right optimizer for your use case
4. Evaluate and compare optimization results
5. Implement custom optimization metrics
6. Debug and troubleshoot optimization issues

### Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapter 3 (Modules)
